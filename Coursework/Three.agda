-- Often concepts in category theory can be phrased as so-called

-- object with a certain property, in the sense that all other objects
-- with the same property maps into the given object. A simple example
-- is the notion of a *terminal* object: this is an object such that
-- every other object has a /unique/ morphism into it. We can describe
-- this as follows:

-- CUTTING THINGS UP (20 MARKS in total)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- In the rest of this Coursework, we will build a window manager in a
-- structured way. This means that we need to be able to cut up the
-- screen in different ways in order to display different windows, so
-- let us first develop the tools to talk about cuts in that way. The
-- following definition can be used to describe how an O can be cut up
-- into a finite list of I-pieces:

record _<|_ (O I : Set) : Set where
  constructor _<!_
  field
    Cuts    : O -> Set  -- for every o : O, there is a set of ways to cut it
    pieces  : {o : O} -> Cuts o -> List I
                        -- and for each cut, there is a list of pieces
open _<|_

-- This is our runnning and motivating example:


NatCut : ℕ <| ℕ
Cuts NatCut z = Σ ℕ \ x -> Σ ℕ \ y -> (x + y) ≡ z
pieces NatCut (x , y , _) = x ∷ y ∷ []

-- See? To cut a natural number z, you choose two numbers x and y such
-- that their sum is x, and the pieces of such a cut is x and y
-- themselves.

-- The following "meaning" of cuts explains how one makes a cut, and
-- decorates all the pieces with a given P : I → Set:

⟦_⟧ : {O I : Set} -> O <| I -> (I -> Set) -> (O -> Set)
⟦ Cu <! ps ⟧ P o = Σ (Cu o) \ c    -- choose a way to cut o

-- Cutting Things Up And Sticking Them Back Together
-----------------------------------------------------

-- This section is the heart of the exercise. It deals with the
-- situation where you have a structure that is subdivided in one way,
-- but you need it to be subdivided in another. That's a situation
-- which arises when you need to display multiple layers of
-- overlapping windows. The cutting structure of the front layer
-- determines which parts of the back layers you can see. So you will
-- need to *impose* the front structure onto the back layer, in order
-- to extract its visible parts.

module _ {I}(C : I <| I) where  -- we fix some notion of cutting

  -- A "Cutter" is a way of taking a *whole* thing and *choosing* how to cut
  -- it into the specified collection of *pieces*.

  Cutter : (I -> Set) -> Set
  Cutter P = {i : I}(c : Cuts C i)   -- given a size, choose how to cut
          -> P i                     -- and, given a whole P,

  --
  -- But suppose we *wish* that it was cut differently, e.g., here:

  --
  -- If we are able to cut up the recursive substructures wherever we want,
